# Scanner

If the filename is not provided after the name of the compiled program (when running in terminal), the program will tell you to enter a file name. If the filename is incorrect/not found, the program will tell you that the file cannot be opened. 

On my submission, I have provided the test cases like the one I put on my project report to test if my program works correctly.
